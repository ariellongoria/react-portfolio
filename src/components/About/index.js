                I am a young web developer learning the marvels constructing the web. I enjoy playing the bass and video
                games in my spare time. I graduated from the University of Texas as a mechanical engineer in 2020, but
                since I have been learning about web development through a bootcamp hosted by UT as well. I have found
                it challenging and fun to learn about JavaScript and the back-end mostly, but front-end development with
                React is quite interesting as well. I am still gaining knowledge about all of this, and I am certainly
                no expert, but I believe I can learn even more in a work setting.
